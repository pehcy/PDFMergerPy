# PDFMergerPy
PDF meger with Tkinter GUI

python virtual env 3.7

## About This Repository
The main reason I wrote this code is that my EPSON 350 scanner can only allowed 
me to scan a PDF document one at a time, which means I scanned one page per time. 

I attempt to create a desktop PDF Merger for my own machine, so that the scanned 
document can be combined into a single PDF.

## Installation
Before you execute the python script, you should create a virtualenv for Python3.8 
as I am using the latest version for Python3.

```shell
make env python=python3
sudo build essential make && make install
```

## TODO
test whether `setup.py` and makefile works while running build command
